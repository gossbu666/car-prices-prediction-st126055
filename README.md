**Car Price Prediction (Machine Learning Assignment)**

**Project Overview**

This project develops a car price prediction system.
The solution includes:
	‚Ä¢	Task 1: Dataset Preparation & Model Training (EDA, preprocessing, model selection, inference).
	‚Ä¢	Task 2: Report (summary & analysis of results).
	‚Ä¢	Task 3: Deployment (Dash web app for price prediction).

Dataset used: Cars dataset

**Note on model.joblib**
The trained model is not included in this repo due to GitHub‚Äôs 100MB limit.
‚û°Ô∏è To reproduce: run the notebook st126055_CarPrice.ipynb, which will save the trained model into app/model.joblib.

**Setup & Usage**

1. Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run Notebook (Training + Export Model)

jupyter notebook notebooks/st126055_CarPrice.ipynb

This will train the model and save it as:

app/model.joblib

3. Run Dash app (locally)

cd app
python app.py

Then open: üëâ http://localhost:8050

4. Run with Docker

docker compose up --build


**Notes & Issues**
	The Random Forest model was chosen as the final model because it achieved the best performance (MAE ‚âà 28K, RMSE ‚âà 126K, R¬≤ ‚âà 0.98).
	One challenge was that the trained model file exceeded GitHub‚Äôs 100MB limit.
	‚úÖ Solution: we compressed the model into a smaller version, which still works properly for inference in the Dash app.
	If you want maximum precision, you can stop at the original (uncompressed) model step in the notebook and run Dash directly with that version.
